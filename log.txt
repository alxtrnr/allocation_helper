Problem MODEL has 3804 rows, 1921 columns and 9148 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Option for timeMode changed from cpu to elapsed
Continuous objective value is 6 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0002I 1848 variables fixed
Cgl0004I processed model has 104 rows, 61 columns (60 integer (60 of which binary)) and 394 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 0.9999
Cbc0038I Initial state - 0 integers unsatisfied sum - 0
Cbc0038I Solution found of 6
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives 6
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 60 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.01 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of 6 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of 6 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.01 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective 6, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.02 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from 6 to 6
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
