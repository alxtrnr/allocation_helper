# Quick Start Guide

## Issue Fixed âœ…

**Problem:** Gaps in allocation tables, solver reporting "infeasible"

**Cause:** Staff duration field not matching actual working hours

**Solution:** Automatic data integrity enforcement at all entry points

## What Changed

The application now **automatically maintains data consistency**:

1. âœ… When you add staff, `duration` is set to match working hours
2. âœ… When you edit times in the UI, `duration` is auto-updated
3. âœ… Invalid time ranges are rejected with clear error messages
4. âœ… Existing database records have been verified and are consistent

## Running the Application

```bash
# Start the Streamlit application
streamlit run app.py
```

## Testing Data Integrity

```bash
# Check if database is consistent
python3 fix_existing_data.py

# Check if allocations are feasible
python3 -m pytest services/ solver/ -v

# Should show:
# âœ… All records consistent
# âœ… All 16 tests passing
```

## Using the Application

### Adding Staff

1. Go to the Staff tab
2. Click "Add Staff"
3. Enter name, select role and gender
4. Set start and end times
5. **Duration is calculated automatically** - you don't need to set it

### Editing Staff Times

1. Use the staff data editor
2. Change start or end times
3. **Duration updates automatically**
4. Changes are validated (end time must be > start time)

### Running Allocations

1. Ensure staff are marked as "Assigned"
2. Ensure patients have observation levels set
3. Click "Generate Allocations"
4. **Result:** Complete, gap-free allocation table

## Validation Rules

The application enforces these rules automatically:

- âœ… `start_time` must be between 0 and 12
- âœ… `end_time` must be between 0 and 12
- âœ… `end_time` must be greater than `start_time`
- âœ… `duration` always equals `end_time - start_time`

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "infeasible" errors:

1. **Check staff availability:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "from sqlalchemy import create_engine; from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker; from services.staff_service import check_allocation_feasibility; engine = create_engine('sqlite:///ward_db_alxtrnr.db'); Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine); session = Session(); result = check_allocation_feasibility(session); print(result); session.close()"
   ```

2. **Verify sufficient staff:**
   - For each hour, ensure assigned staff >= total observation needs
   - Example: 2 patients with level-2 obs = need 4 staff for that hour

3. **Check the log:**
   ```bash
   cat log.txt
   ```

### If you see data inconsistency errors:

```bash
# Run the fix script
python3 fix_existing_data.py
```

This should never be necessary as the application now prevents inconsistencies, but it's available if needed.

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check `log.txt` for solver diagnostics
2. Run `fix_existing_data.py` to verify database
3. Run `pytest` to ensure all tests pass
4. Review the documentation files listed above

## Success Indicators

You know everything is working when:

- âœ… All tests pass (16/16)
- âœ… Feasibility check returns "Success: True"
- âœ… Allocations generate without errors
- âœ… No gaps in the allocation table
- âœ… All patients covered for all required hours

The application is now ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
